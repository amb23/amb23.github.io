Just finished writing up (a first cut of) <a href="/assets/files/configuration-spaces.pdf">notes</a>
 on the construction of the configuration spaces
used by Kontsevich for part of the proof of the formality conjecture. The
configuration spaces without boundary had been studied in detail by Fulton and
MacPherson and they have the corresponding operad named after them.

What is particularly interesting about these spaces is that they are stratified
into very tractable objects - trees and trees where edges have types. Moerover
the tree structure has a very comprehensible geometric picture when thought of
in terms of observable distances: stepping down the tree requires one to
magnify the space to greater detail than can be observed from the top level.

This smells a lot like renormalisation - in particular when you look at typed
(or coloured operads) one can't help but think of Feynman diagrams when drawing
the associated trees. I think that the work of Gwilliam
and Costello likely cover the application of such operads but I am actually
massively hopeful that this could provide a really solid foundation for
understanding what renormalization actually is and feels like.
